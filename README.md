Our website is an event ticketing website where users should be able to create/edit their own events as well as register/favorite other users events.

Although not registered/logged in users can see events, they are not able to take other actions such as registering for events or creating events until they log in.

When the user first visits the site, they should be on the homepage where they can see a list of events and links to login, register, and visit the homepage at the top.

Click on the register link to reach the registration page to create an account, and click on the login link to reach the login page to sign in.

Once logged in, the user should see a new homepage where at the top these links/search bar will be displayed

Your Homepage - click on this link to view events to register/favorite
Create Event - click on this link to create your own event
Your Events - click on this link to see all of the events that you have created
Your Registered Events - click on this link to see all of the events that you have registered for
Your Favorited Events - click on this link to see all of the events that you have favorited

When you click on an event, you will be taken to a page to see its event details, comments, and buttons to either register/deregister for the event or favorite/unfavorite the event as well as being able to comment

If you are the owner of the event, you will also be able to edit the event or cancel the event. When events are cancelled, when users see the event on the homepage, they will see a cancelled label over it.
